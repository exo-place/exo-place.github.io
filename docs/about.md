# About exo

exo-place builds biomes — non-infrastructure-dependent places to exist.

Where [rhi](https://rhi.zone/about) is glue layer (infrastructure, tooling, the substrate), exo is about what you do with it: places, identities, worlds.

## Philosophy

Software creates places. A Discord server is a place. A wiki is a place. A MUD is a place. But most software makes places that are rigid — defined by their developers, not their inhabitants.

exo projects create places where the inhabitants define the space:

- **Entities over schemas.** Things exist because you describe them, not because a developer predicted them.
- **Navigate and edit over script.** The fundamental interactions are moving through a space and changing what's there — not writing code.
- **Definitions over behavior.** What something *is* matters more than what it *does*. Behavior emerges from identity.

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [hologram](https://github.com/exo-place/hologram) | Discord bot for collaborative worldbuilding — entities with text-based definitions |
| [aspect](https://github.com/exo-place/aspect) | Card-based identity exploration sandbox — navigate and edit as primitives |

## Relationship to rhi

exo-place projects are biomes that can grow on any substrate. They don't depend on rhi infrastructure, but they share sensibilities:

- Bun/TypeScript runtime
- VitePress documentation
- Nix development environments
- Conventional commits
